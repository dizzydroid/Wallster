### Known issues: 
- The "Get Link" button on the (Share) module does not display an alert when link is copied, but trust me bro, it's copied.
- Loading of images depends highly on internet speed due to a different fetching method used than the one I used to build the site initially.
- The site is not yet optimized for mobile viewing.
- Did I miss any? 👉️ Report any other <a href = "https://github.com/dizzydroid/Wallster/issues"><b>issues</b></a> you encounter!
